# Overview

This is my simple Hello World program. I used this to learn how all the pieces of my development environment work together. There will be bigger and better things in the future!

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write the code, Git to compile and store the code locally on my computer, and GitHub to store the code on an online server.

This code was written in Python. At this point in time, Python is the only coding language I know, but I will be learning other languages.
